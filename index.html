    <p>My name is Caroline and I'm currently training to be a full-stack developer at futureproof.
     This is going to be a place to show all of my work (eventually). For now, a little bit about me:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>I am an English Literature graduate and I used to work in publishing!</li>
        <li>My first coding experience was when I was 15 with MySpace - I smothered my profile with HTML and gifs</li>
        <li>I once owned 5 different blogs - apparently I loved designing the front end more than the actual writing..</li>
    </ul>
